             draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components-latest

Abstract

   SCION is a future Internet architecture that focuses on security and
   availability.  Its fundamental functions are carried out by a number
   of components.

   This document illustrates the dependencies between its core
   components and extensions.  We also discuss the relationship between
   SCION and existing protocols, with focus on illustrating which
   existing protocols are reused/extended.  We also describe the
   motivations behind cases where a greenfield approach is needed, and
   the properties that can be achieved thanks to it.  We then briefly
   touch on the maturity level of components.

1.  Introduction

   While SCION was initially developed in academia, the architecture has
   now "slipped out of the lab" and counts its early productive
   deployments (including the Swiss inter-banking network SSFN).  The
   architecture is composed of a system of related components, some of
   which are essential to set up end to end SCION connectivity, while
   others are add-ons aiming at providing additional functionality,
   security, or backwards compatibility.  Discussions at
   [PANRG-INTERIM-Min] showed the need to describe the relationships
   between SCION's core components.  In this document we therefore focus
   on each component, describing its functionality, dependencies and
   relationships to existing protocols.  The goal is not to describe
   each component specification, rather to provide a basis for
   discussions about the engineering decisions that made SCION what it
   is.  We first start from core components, that form a SCION minimal
   stack.  We then move onto extensions and additional components.

   TODO: Feedback Corine.. in the introduction, reiterate why the
   properties that SCION offers are actually needed and relevant..
   Adrian wanted to actually achieve them.  For each property, we can
   first stress how the current Internet fulfills these properties, and
   then stress why SCION achieves them better.  We can do this for the 3
   core components.  So overall, for each property, first explain why
   they are important, why they cannot be achieved, and why SCION's
   approach achieves them.

   Before reading this document, please refer to
   [I-D.dekater-scion-overview] for a generic overview of SCION and its
   components, the problems it solves, and existing deployments.  For an
   in-depth description of SCION, please refer to [CHUAT22].

2.  Design goal: fundamental properties

3.  Minimal stack - core components

   In order to establish end to end connectivity, SCION relies on three
   main components.  SCION's data plane carries out secure path-aware
   forwarding.  Its control plane takes case of routing.  SCION relies
   on the Control Plane PKI to handle cryptographic material.

   The control plane is responsible for discovering and disseminating
   routing information.  Route discovery is performed by each autonomous
   system (AS) thanks to an authenticated path-exploration mechanism
   called beaconing.  SCION end hosts query their respective AS control
   plane and obtain authenticated and authorized network paths, in the
   form of path segments.  End hosts select one or more of the end to
   end network paths, based on the application requirements (i.e.,
   latency).  End hosts then craft SCION packets containing the end-to
   end path to the destination.  The data plane is responsible for
   forwarding SCION packets while authenticating them at each hop and.

   Both the control and data plane rely on the control-plane PKI for
   authentication and authorization.  SCION's authentication mechanisms
   aim at protecting the whole end to end path at each hop.  SCION
   Autonomous systems are organised in Isolation Domains (ISDs), that
   independently define their own roots of trust.  ISD members share an
   uniform trust environment (i.e., a common jurisdiction).  They can
   transparently define trust relationships between parts of the network
   by deciding wether to trust other ISDs.  SCION therefore relies on an
   unique trust model, which is different from other PKI.  We clarify
   the motivation behind this in Authentication (Section 3.3)

   All above mentioned core components are deployed in production (i.e.,
   they are in use within the the SSFN, the Swiss Finance Network).
   There are commercial implementations of all core components
   (including a high performance data-plane).

3.1.  Routing - Control Plane

   The SCION control plane's main purpose is to discover and disseminate
   routing information, in the form of path segments.  Path exploration
   is based on path-segment construction beacons (PCBs), that are
   initiated by a subset of ASes and accumulate cryptographically
   protected path forwarding information.  Each AS selects a few PCBs
   and makes them available to end hosts via its path service.  End
   hosts query the control plane for path segments, and combine them
   into forwarding paths to transmit packets in the data plane.  For an
   overview of the process to create and disseminate path information,
   refer to [I-D.dekater-scion-overview] section 1.2.2.

3.1.1.  Key properties in relationship to existing protocols

   On a first sight, it might seem that SCION control plane takes care
   of similar duties as of BGP.  While both focus on disseminating
   routing information, there are substantial differences in the
   properties provided and mechanisms.  We describe the core properties
   provided by the SCION control plane, and its relationships with
   existing protocols.

   *  _Host addressing._.  SCION decouples routing from end-host
      addressing, so inter-domain routing is based on ISD-AS tuples.
      SCION is agnostic to end-host addressing, therefore its control
      plane does not carry carry prefix information.  SCION therefore
      can reuse existing end-host addressing mechanisms, as IPv6 or
      IPv4.

   *  _Multipath._ SCION ASes can select PCBs according to their
      policies, and register the corresponding path segments, making
      them available to other ASes and end hosts.  SCION hosts can
      leverage a wide range of inter-domain paths, selecting them hop by
      hop based on application requirements or path conditions.  Another
      mechanism is BGP mutlipath [RFC7911], focus on providing a backup
      path.  However, it does not allow end hosts to select end to end
      path, and it faces scalability concerns typical of BGP, as
      discussed in the above mentioned RFC.  Such concerns motivate an
      alternative approach as SCION.

   *  _Hop by hop path authorization._ SCION packets can only be
      forwarded along authorized segments.  This is achieved thanks to
      message authentication codes (MACs) within each hop field.  During
      beaconing, each AS control's plane creates MACs, that are then
      verified at forwarding.  This gives end hosts strong guarantees
      about the path where the data is routed.  Other approaches, as
      BGPSec ([RFC8205]), suffer from challenges with scalability, and
      introduce circular dependencies [137] and global kill switches
      [441] TODO: if we keep this, add citations from book

   *  _Scalability._ SCION beaconing algorithm is around two orders of
      magnitude more efficient than BGP due to the following reasons:
      the routing process is divided in a process within each ISD and
      one inter-ISD, SCION beaconing does not need to iteratively
      converge, SCION makes AS-based announcements instead of BGP's
      prefix-based announcements.  Please refer to [KRAHENBUHL2022] for
      an in-depth study of SCION's scalability.

   *  _Convergence time._ Since routing decisions are decoupled from
      dissemination of path information, SCION does not suffer from the
      long convergence times that affect path-vector protocols such as
      BGP.  Path information is propagated across the network by PCBs in
      times that are within the same order of magnitude of network round
      trip time.  This means that SCION has the capability to restore
      global reachability, even after catastrophic failures, in minutes.
      In addition, in certain situations, BGP will never converge to a
      stable state, or converge only non-deterministically (see
      [GRIFFIN1999] and [RFC4264].  Convergence may also take too much
      time [SAHOO2009].  TODO: Is SCION immune form such issues (as
      there is no convergence)?

   *  _Transparency._ SCION end-hosts have full visibility about the
      inter-domain path their data is forwarded.  This is a property
      that is missing in traditional IP networks, where have no
      visibility nor guarantees on where their traffic is forwarded.
      SCION makes it harder to redirect traffic through an adversary's
      vantage point.

   *  _Fault isolation._ As the SCION routing process is divided in
      intra-ISD and inter-ISD, faults can have a more limited impact.
      On the other hand, a single faulty BGP speaker can adversely
      impact routing globally.  TODO: I would be a bit more precise:
      what kind of fault would be contained?  A path service going nuts
      or being compromised?  And BGP is bad, but maybe we should mention
      that some of the issues (like hijacking) are mitigated by RPKI.

   *  _Authenticated control messages._ BGP has no built-in security
      mechanisms and does not provide any tools for ASes to authenticate
      the information they receive through BGP update messages.  This
      opens up a multitude of attack opportunities.  SCION control-plane
      messages, instead, are all authenticated.  In addition, currently
      the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) lacks an
      authenticated counterpart, see [RFC4443] and [RFC0791].
      Unauthenticated ICMP messages can potentially be used to affect or
      even prevent traffic forwarding.  SCION provides the SCION Control
      Message Protocol (SCMP), which is analogous to ICMP.  It provides
      functionality for network diagnostics, such as ping and
      traceroute, and error messages that signal packet processing or
      network-layer problems.  SCMP is the first control message
      protocol supports the authentication of network control messages.
      TODO: I'm not sure how much I want to go into SCMP here..
      Especially as SCMP packets are only authenticated if DRKey/SPAO
      are used

   The SCION control plane is dependent on the control-plane PKI (#pki)
   for authenticating control information.  TODO: Maybe we could go into
   more detail (i.e. verifying a path with CP certificates?)  Maybe we
   can do this in the PKI section?

   TODO: add a few sentences on why the CP avoids mistakes in lessons
   learned from RFC9049

   TODO: Corine feedback: maybe it is good to have global properties
   mentione before digging into specific components? - _Security_: TODO:
   overview of why SCION is secure

   *  _Transparency_

   *  _Path awareness_

3.2.  Forwarding - Data plane

   SCION is an inter-domain network architecture and as such does not
   interfere with intra-domain forwarding.  This corresponds to the
   general practice today where BGP and IP are used for inter-domain
   routing and forwarding, respectively, but ASes use an intra-domain
   protocol of their choice, (i.e., OSPF or IS-IS for routing and IP,
   MPLS, SR and various layer-2 protocols for forwarding).  SCION
   therefore re-uses the intra-domain network fabric to provide
   connectivity among its infrastructure services, border routers, and
   end hosts, minimising changes to the internal infrastructure.

   SCION routers are deployed at the network edge.  They receive and
   validate SCION packets from neighbours, then they use their intra-
   domain forwarding information to transmit packets to the next border
   router or SCION end-host.

   SCION packets sit at network-layer (layer-3), and the SCION header
   sits between the transport-layer (layer-4) and link-layer (layer-2).
   They contain a variable type and length end-host address, and can
   therefore carry any address (IPv4, IPv6, ...).  In addition, ed host
   addresses only need to be unique within an AS, and can be, in
   principle, reused.  In early deployments, intra-AS SCION packets are
   sometimes encapsulated into an IP packet, for backwards
   compatibility.

3.2.1.  Key properties in relationship to existing protocols

   Thanks to its data plane, SCION achieves properties that are
   difficult to achieve when exclusively extending existing protocols.

   *  _Programmable paths._ SCION end hosts select network paths based
      on application requirements, rather than routers.  This approach
      is such that there is no need to include semantics in packets, as
      routing decisions are left to end hosts.  In addition, when
      comparing to proposed semantic routing (TODO: reference)
      approaches, with SCION hosts gain better visibility into network
      paths.  TODO: I'm not sure if we want to explicitly say that this
      approach has advantages to semantic routing.. Maybe we don't want
      to mention it? https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-farrel-irtf-
      introduction-to-semantic-routing-04.html#I-D.king-irtf-semantic-
      routing-survey TODO: @Adrian, I remember you don't like the
      expression "programmable paths".. Anything better?  "Path
      selection"?

   *  *Scalability.* SCION routers can efficiently forward packets
      without the need to look up forwarding tables and without keeping
      per-connection state.  Routers only need to verify MACs in hop
      fields.  This operation is based on modern block ciphers such as
      AES, can be computed faster than performing a memory lookup and it
      is widely supported in modern CPUs.  Routers, therefore, do not
      require expensive and energy-intensive dedicated hardware, and can
      be deployed on off-the-shelf hardware.  Lack of forwarding tables
      also implies that the growing size of forwarding tables is of no
      concern.  Additionally, routers that keep state for network
      information can suffer from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
      exhausting the router's state [SCHUCHARD2011].

   *  _Recovery from failures._ SCION hosts usually receive more than
      one path to a given destination.  Each host can select
      (potentially disjoint) backup paths that are readily available in
      case of failure.  In contrast to the IP Internet, SCION packets
      are not dynamically rerouted in the network in case of failures.
      Routers use BFD [RFC5880] to detect link failures, and in case
      they cannot forward a packet they send an authenticated SCMP
      message triggering path revocation.  End hosts can use this
      information, or alternatively active monitoring, to quickly
      reroute trafifc in case of failures.  There is therefore no need
      to wait for BGP convergence.

   *  _Extensibility_ SCION, similarly to IPv6, supports extensions in
      its header.  Such extensions can be hop-by-hop and end-to-end.

   *  _Backwards compatibility._ SCION packets support any kind of end-
      host addressing.  IP packets can therefore be transported over
      SCION by interposing a SCION to IP Gateway (SIG).  TODO: reference
      if we talk more about it later.

3.2.2.  SCION and Segment Routing

   Given its path-aware properties, some of SCION's characteristics
   might seem similar to the ones provided by Segment Routing (SR)
   [RFC8402].  There are, however, fundamental differences that
   distinguish and motivate SCION.  The most salient one is that Segment
   Routing is designed to be deployed across a single trusted domain.
   SR therefore does not focus on security, which remains an open
   question.  SCION, instead, is designed from inception to allow inter-
   domain communication between mutually distrustful entities.  It
   comes, therefore, with an arsenal of tools to prevent attacks (i.e.,
   authenticating all control plane messages and all critical fields in
   the data-plane header).  Rather than competing, SCION and SR could
   potentially complement each other.  SCION relies on existing intra-
   domain routing protocols, therefore SR could represent one of the
   possible intra-domain routing protocols.  Possible integration of
   their path-aware properties remain for now an open question.

   TODO: Maybe cite https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-li-spring-
   srv6-security-consideration/ TODO: maybe this paragraph can go at the
   end, in a paragraph where we discuss SICON vs related work (inclding
   BGP with colors, semantic routing, ...)

3.3.  Authentication - SCION PKI

   SCION's control plane messages are all authenticated.  The
   verification of those messages relies on a public-key infrastructure
   (PKI) called the control-plane PKI or CP-PKI.  It consists of a set
   of mechanisms, roles, and policies related to the management and
   usage of certificates, which enable the verification of signatures,
   e.g., on path construction beacons (PCBs).  One might ask why SCION
   requires its own PKI, rather than reusing some of the existing PKI
   architectures.  There are several properties that distinguish the CP-
   PKI from others, and motivate SCION's distinct approach.

   _Unique decentralised trust model_. SCION is designed to enable
   global secure connectivity, where ASes do not necessarily share
   mutual trust.  This requires a trust model that is different from
   existing ones that are behind commonly deployed PKIs in today's
   Internet.  In a monopolistic model, all entities trust a single root
   of trust (e.g., in DNSSEC).  In an oligopolistic model, there are
   multiple equally trusted roots (e.g., in the Web PKI).  In both
   models, some or all certification authorities are omnipotent.  If
   their key is compromised, then the security of the entire system
   collapses.  Both models do not scale well to a global environment,
   because mutually distrustful entities cannot agree on a single root
   of trust (monopoly) and because in the oligopoly model, the security
   is as strong as its weakest root.  The SCION trust model differs from
   classic PKIs in two ways.  First, no entity is omnipotent, as
   Isolation Domains elect their own root of trust, and the capabilities
   of each ISDs (authentication-wise) are limited to communication
   channels in which they are involved.  Second, the trust roots of each
   ISD are co-located in a single file, the TRC, which is co-signed by
   multiple entities in a process called voting.

   *  _Absence of global kill switches_. Authentication relies on local
      trust roots, limiting the scope of authorities and offering local
      sovereign.  Monopolistic trust root architectures such as DNSSEC
      and RPKI/BGPsec enable entities in possession of private keys to
      shut down portions of the namespace controlled by those keys.  The
      introduction of these kill switches into DNS and BGP has created
      skepticism and concern over the potential outages that could arise
      should private keys be misused or fall into the wrong hands [441].
      In addition, during periods of global tensions, there are often
      calls to use some of today's Internet kill switches to potentially
      shut down connectivity in portions of the Internet.  IN SCION, the
      fact that each ISD can manage its own roots of trust
      independently, prevents such external kill switches.  TODO: add
      citation 441

   *  _Resilience to compromised entities and keys._ Compromised or
      malicious trust roots outside an ISD cannot affect operations that
      stay within that ISD.  Moreover, each ISD can be configured to
      withstand the compromise of any single voting key.

   *  _Trust flexibility_: Each ISD can define its own trust policy.
      ASes must accept the trust policy of the ISD(s) in which they
      participate, but they can decide which ISDs they want to join, and
      they can participate in multiple ISDs.

   *  _Scalability_: The authentication infrastructure scales to the
      size of the Internet and is adapted to the heterogeneity of
      today's Internet constituents.

   *  _A basis for authentication of data-plane messages_.
      Authentication based on digital signatures works well for the
      relatively low message rates in the control plane, but it does not
      meet the performance requirements for the high message rate of the
      data plane.  The authentication of data-plane traffic and control
      messages requires a highly efficient and ideally stateless system
      to achieve bandwidths of several Gbps on commodity hardware, and
      to avoid creating opportunities for DoS attacks.  SCION comprises
      a component called DRKey, which enables high-speed data-plane
      components, like border routers, to derive symmetric cryptographic
      keys from local secrets only.  Such component is used to
      authenticate SCMP messages.  Today's Internet also lacks a
      fundamental mechanism to share a secret key between two end hosts
      for secure end-to-end communication.  Existing approaches (i.e.,
      SSH) resort to trust-on-first-use (TOFU) approach, where an host's
      initial public key is accepted without verification.  DRKey
      addresses such issue.  For more information, refer to the draft
      [I-D.garciapardo-drkey].

   The CP-PKI is based on certificates that follow the X.509v3 standard
   [RFC5280].  There are several professional industry-grade
   implementations, e.g., by SIX, the main financial infrastructure and
   service provider in Switzerland.  Trust within an ISD is normally
   bootstrapped with an initial ceremony.  Subsequent updates to the
   root of trust are handled automatically.

3.3.1.  SCION and RPKI

   One might ask why SCION could not just rely on RPKI.  Summarising on
   the points above, the CP-PKI distinguishes itself because of the
   trust model, which comprises independent trust roots that are a
   fundamental building block for SCION's Isolation Domains.  RPKI's
   trust model follows the same structure as the IP allocation
   hierarchy, where the five RIRs run a CA.  This clashes with the trust
   model required for SCION's Isolation Domains.  In addition, RPKI is
   only meant to provide authorisation, but not authentication.  SCION
   indeed does not provide, by design, IP authorisation.  Rather, as we
   further describe in the next section, one of IP to SCION's
   coexistence mechanisms (SIAM) relies on RPKI for IP origin
   attestation.

4.  Transition mechanisms

   As we presented in [I-D.dekater-scion-overview], SCION comprises
   multiple transition mechanisms that allow an incremental deployment
   and coexistence with existing protocols.  Such approaches require
   different level of changes in existing systems, and have different
   maturity levels (from research to production).  Rather than
   describing how each mechanism works, we provide a short summary of
   the approach, focusing on what its functions, properties, and
   protocols it reuses, extend or interact with.

   *  _SCION-IP-Gateway (SIG)_.  A SCION-IP-Gateway (SIG) encapsulates
      regular IP packets into SCION packets with a corresponding SIG at
      the destination that performs the decapsulation.  This mechanism
      enables legacy IP end hosts to benefit from a SCION deployment by
      transparently obtaining improved security and availability
      properties.  SCION routing policies can be configured on SIGs, in
      order to select appropriate SCION paths based on application
      requirements.  SIGs have the ability to dynamically exchange
      prefix information, currently using their own encapsulation and
      prefix exchange protocol.  This does not exclude reusing existing
      protocols in the future.  SIGs are deployed in production SCION
      networks, and there are commercial implementations.

   *  _SIAM_. To make SIGs a viable transition mechanism in an Internet-
      scale network with tens of thousands of ASes, an automatic
      configuration system is required.  SIAM creates mappings between
      legacy IPs and SCION addresses, relying on the authorisations in
      the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  SIAM is currently
      a research prototype, further described in [SUPRAJA2021].

   *  _SBAS_ is an experimental architecture aiming at extending
      benefits of SCION (in terms of performance and routing security)
      to potentially any IP host on the Internet.  SBAS consists of a
      federated backbone of entities.  SBAS appears on the outside
      Internet as a regular BGP-speaking AS.  Customers of SBAS can
      leverage the system to route traffic across the SCION network
      according to their requirements (i.e., latency, geography, ... ).
      SBAS contains globally distributed PoPs that advertise its
      customer's announcements.  Traffic is therefore routed as close as
      possible to the source onto the SCION network.  The system is
      further described in chapter 13 of [CHUAT22].  TODO: I find it
      very difficult to explain SBAS in a few lines... It is quite a big
      system and I'm not so sure we should talk about it.  I'm afraid it
      might distract the focus.

5.  Additional components

   TODO: Mayne instead of having bullet points, we can just have a
   paragraph.  This way we don't give too much importance about this
   section. - _End-host stack_. SCION can be deployed though the use of
   SICON-to-IP conversion or natively on end hosts. - Happy eyeballs
   (and how we extend it) - DrKey & dependencies -->
   [I-D.garciapardo-drkey] - LightningFilter -->
   https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/111/materials/slides-111-panrg-
   lightning-filter-high-speed-traffic-filtering-based-on-drkey - SCMP -
   COLIBRI (Bandwidth Reservations) - _RHINE_ (formerly RAINS)

6.  Dependency analysis

   This section briefly discusses dependencies between SCION's core
   components, with the goal of facilitating a discussion on
   standardization.  TODO: this section contains just notes, to be
   rephrased

   *  Only PKI - authentication: Overall, the PKI, with its trust model,
      constitutes the most independent unit that could be potentially be
      leveraged by SCION and other protocols.  The PKI itself does not
      have significant dependencies on other pieces, therefore a good
      starting point would be to describe its trust properties,
      inrerfaces, and processes.

   *  Only control plane - beaconing & path server infrastructure The
      SCION control plane relies on the CP-PKI to authenticate entities.
      It would therefore make sense to define the CP in parallel with
      PKI.  Decoupling it from PKI would severely affect the properties
      and guarantees that can be provided by the CP

   *  Only data plane - path construction and packet forwarding DP needs
      a way to authenticate path information.. If not, it would not make
      sense to have SCION for inter-domain.. We would just mimick SR and
      it would be useless on inter-domain, where the trust model is
      different.  As discussed in [RFC9049], lack of authentication has
      often been the cause of some protocols never taking off because of
      security concerns (see Section 6.5 (Trigtran), 6.7 (NSIS) of the
      mentioned draft. )

   *  Only other components (i.e., SCMP) TODO

7.  Conclusions

   We described key SCION components with their properties and
   dependencies.  TODO: I would add some comments on how SCION avoids
   some of the issues mentioned in [RFC9049] Also mention that the most
   important core components are formally verified.
