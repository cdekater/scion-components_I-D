             draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components-latest

Abstract

   SCION is a future Internet architecture that focuses on security and
   availability.  Its fundamental functions are carried out by a number
   of components.

   This document illustrates the dependencies between its core
   components, extensions.  We also discuss the relationship between
   SCION and existing protocols, with focus on illustrating which
   existing protocols are reused/extended.  We also describe the
   motivations behind cases where a greenfield approach is needed.  We
   also briefly touch on the maturity level of components.

1.  Introduction

   While SCION was initially developed in academia, the architecture has
   now "slipped out of the lab" and counts its early productive
   deployments (including the Swiss inter-banking network SSFN).  The
   architecture consists of a system of related components, some of
   which are essential to set up end to end SCION connectivity, while
   others are add-ons aiming at providing additional functionality,
   security, or backwards compatibility.  Discussions at
   [PANRG-INTERIM-Min] showed the need to describe the relationships
   between SCION's core components.  In this document we therefore focus
   on each component, describing its functionality, dependencies and
   relationships to existing protocols.  The goal is not to describe
   each component specification, rather to provide a basis for
   discussions about the engineering decisions that made SCION what it
   is.  We first start from core components, that form a SCION minimal
   stack.  We then move onto extensions and additional components, some
   of which provide compatibility mechanisms between SCION and existing
   protocols.

   Before reading this document, please refer to [DEKATER2022] for a
   generic overview of SCION and its components, the problems it solves,
   and existing deployments.  For an in-depth description of SCION,
   please refer to [CHUAT22].

2.  Minimal stack - core components

   In order to establish end to end connectivity, SCION relies on three
   main components.  SCION's data plane carries out secure path-aware
   forwarding.  Its control plane takes case of routing.  SCION relies
   on the Control Plane PKI to handle cryptographic material.

   The control plane is responsible for discovering and disseminating
   routing information.  Route discovery is performed by each autonomous
   system (AS) thanks to an authenticated path-exploration mechanism
   called beaconing.  SCION end hosts query their respective AS control
   plane and obtain authenticated and authorized network paths, in the
   form of path segments.  End hosts select one or more of the end to
   end network paths, based on the application requirements (i.e.,
   latency).  End hosts then craft SCION packets containing the end-to
   end path to the destination.  The data plane is responsible for
   forwarding SCION packets while authenticating them at each hop and.

   Both the control and data plane rely on the control-plane PKI for
   authentication and authorization.  SCION's authentication mechanisms
   aim at protecting the whole end to end path at each hop.  SCION
   Autonomous systems are organised in Isolation Domains (ISDs), that
   independently define their own roots of trust.  ISD members share an
   uniform trust environment (i.e., a common jurisdiction).  They can
   transparently define trust relationships between parts of the network
   by deciding wether to trust other ISDs.  SCION therefore relies on an
   unique trust model, which is markably different from other PKI.  We
   clarify the motivation behind this in Authentication (Section 2.3)

   All above mentioned core components are deployed in production (i.e.,
   they are in use within the the SSFN, the Swiss Finance Network).
   There are commercial implementations of all core components
   (including a high performance data-plane).

2.1.  Routing - Control Plane

   The SCION control plane's main purpose is to discover and disseminate
   routing information, in the form of path segments.  Path exploration
   is based on path-segment construction beacons (PCBs), that are
   initiated by a subset of ASes and accumulate cryptographically
   protected path forwarding information.  Each AS selects a few PCBs
   and makes them available to end hosts via its path service.  End
   hosts query the control plane for path segments, and combine them
   into forwarding paths to transmit packets in the data plane.  For an
   overview of the process to create and disseminate path information,
   refer to [DEKATER2022] section 1.2.2.

2.1.1.  Key properties in relationship to existing protocols

   On a first sight, it might seem that SCION control plane takes care
   of similar duties as of BGP.  While both focus on disseminating
   routing information, there are substantial differences in the
   properties provided and mechanisms.  We describe the core properties
   provided by the SCION control plane, and its relationships with
   existing protocols.

   *  _Host addressing._.  SCION decouples routing from end-host
      addressing, so inter-domain routing is based on ISD-AS tuples.
      SCION is agnostic to end-host addressing, therefore its control
      plane does not carry carry prefix information.  SCION therefore
      can reuse existing end-host addressing mechanisms, as IPv6 or
      IPv4.

   *  _Multipath._ SCION ASes can select PCBs according to their
      policies, and register the corresponding path segments, making
      them available to other ASes and end hosts.  SCION hosts can
      leverage a wide range of inter-domain paths, selecting them hop by
      hop based on application requirements or path conditions.  Another
      mechanism is BGP mutlipath [RFC7911], focus on providing a backup
      path.  However, it does not allow end hosts to select end to end
      path, and it faces scalability concerns typical of BGP, as
      discussed in the above mentioned RFC.  Such concerns motivate an
      alternative approach as SCION.

   *  _Hop by hop path authorization._ SCION packets can only be
      forwarded along authorized segments.  This is achieved thanks to
      message authentication codes (MACs) within each hop field.  During
      beaconing, each AS control's plane creates MACs, that are then
      verified at forwarding.  This gives end hosts strong guarantees
      about the path where the data is routed.  Other approaches, as
      BGPSec ([RFC8205]), suffer from challenges with scalability, and
      introduce circular dependencies [137] and global kill switches
      [441] TODO: if we keep this, add citations from book

   *  _Scalability._ SCION beaconing algorithm is around two orders of
      magnitude more efficient than BGP due to the following reasons:
      the routing process is divided in a process within each ISD and
      one inter-ISD, SCION beaconing does not need to iteratively
      converge, SCION makes AS-based announcements instead of BGP's
      prefix-based announcements.  Please refer to [KRAHENBUHL2022] for
      an in-depth study of SCION's scalability.

   *  _Convergence time._ Since routing decisions are decoupled from
      dissemination of path information, SCION does not suffer from the
      long convergence times that affect path-vector protocols such as
      BGP.  Path information is propagated across the network by PCBs in
      times that are within the same order of magnitude of network round
      trip time.  This means that SCION has the capability to restore
      global reachability, even after catastrophic failures, in minutes.
      In addition, in certain situations, BGP will never converge to a
      stable state, or converge only non-deterministically (see
      [GRIFFIN1999] and [RFC4264].  Convergence may also take too much
      time [SAHOO2009].  TODO: Is SCION immune form such issues (as
      there is no convergence)?

   *  _Transparency._ SCION end-hosts have full visibility about the
      inter-domain path their data is forwarded.  This is a property
      that is missing in traditional IP networks, where have no
      visibility nor guarantees on where their traffic is forwarded.
      SCION makes it harder to redirect traffic through an adversary's
      vantage point.

   *  _Fault isolation._ As the SCION routing process is divided in
      intra-ISD and inter-ISD, faults can have a more limited impact.
      On the other hand, a single faulty BGP speaker can adversely
      impact routing globally.  TODO: I would be a bit more precise:
      what kind of fault would be contained?  A path service going nuts
      or being compromised?  And BGP is bad, but maybe we should mention
      that some of the issues (like hijacking) are mitigated by RPKI.

   *  _Authenticated control messages._ BGP has no built-in security
      mechanisms and does not provide any tools for ASes to authenticate
      the information they receive through BGP update messages.  This
      opens up a multitude of attack opportunities.  SCION control
      messages, instead, are all authenticated.  In addition, SCION
      comprises the SCION Control Message Protocol (SCMP), which is
      analogous to the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).  It
      provides functionality for network diagnostics, such as ping and
      traceroute, and error messages that signal packet processing or
      network-layer problems.  TODO: I'm not sure how much I want to go
      into SCMP here.. Especially as SCMP packets are only authenticated
      if DRKey/SPAO are used

   The SCION control plane is dependent on the control-plane PKI (#pki)
   for authenticating control information.  TODO: Maybe we could go into
   more detail (i.e. verifying a path with CP certificates?)  Maybe we
   can do this in the PKI section?

2.2.  Forwarding - Data plane

   *  _Path selecction_ is made by end hosts, not routers

   *  *Scalability* The use of forwarding tables in IP routers is time-
      consuming, expensive, and energy-intensive.  Also, the constantly
      growing size of forwarding tables causes storage problems.
      Additionally, routers that keep state for network information can
      suffer from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks exhausting the
      router's state [SCHUCHARD2011].

   *  _Recovery from failure_ TODO: rewrite text BGP only allows the
      selection of a single path to a destination.  But having a multi-
      path choice can be welcome in several situations, e.g., in the
      case of a link failure, for load balancing, or when traffic is
      routed based on different policies.

2.2.1.  SCION and Segment Routing

2.3.  Authentication - SCION PKI

   TODO: why do we need a strong PKI? * Talk about monopoly vs oligopoly
   and why this is important (but maybe in the CP part)? * Why we could
   not just use RPKI 9that we use for origin validation) This makes the
   SCION CP-PKI distinct from other PKIs (i.e. web PKI, RPKI), that
   either have a single root of trust root (monopoly model), or rely on
   a plethora of roots of trust (oligopoly model) leading to a trust
   architecture that supports meaningful trust roots in a global
   environment with inherently distrustful entities.

   *  Absence of Kill Switches Monopolistic trust root architectures
      such as DNSSEC and RPKI/BGPsec en- able entities in possession of
      private keys to shut down portions of the names- pace controlled
      by those keys.  The introduction of these kill switches into DNS
      and BGP has created skepticism and concern over the potential
      outages that could arise should private keys be misused or fall
      into the wrong hands [441].

2.3.1.  Issues with RPKI and BGPsec

   RPKI and BGPsec try to address Internet's above-mentioned security
   shortcomings, see also [RFC6480] and [RFC8205].  However, RPKI and
   BGPsec introduce additional challenges, as shortly described below.

   *  *RPKI and Route Origin Authorizations* Unfortunately, the Route
      Origin Authorizations (ROAs) provided by RPKI only prevent the
      simplest form of BGP hijacks.

2.3.1.1.  Lack of Authentication

   Authenticating digital data is becoming increasingly prevalent, as
   adversaries exploit the absence of authentication to inject malicious
   information.  Specifically, many network protocols do not use
   authentication at all, leaving them exposed to multiple attacks:

   *  Today's Internet lacks a fundamental mechanism to share a secret
      key between two end hosts for secure end-to-end communication.
      Existing approaches (i.e., SSH) resort to trust-on-first-use
      (TOFU) approach, where an host's initial public key is accepted
      without verification.

   *  Infrastructures were added over time to provide authentication,
      such as RPKI/BGPsec, TLS [RFC8446], and DNSSEC [RFC4033].
      However, they are all sensitive to the compromise of a single
      entity.

   *  The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) lacks an
      authenticated counterpart, see [RFC4443] and [RFC0791].
      Unauthenticated ICMP messages can potentially be used to affect or
      even prevent traffic forwarding.  TODO: complete

   RFC9049).  (Maybe we can do this per-component)? * why achieving
   these properties requires a greenfield approach * why this is the
   only way to differentiate from the previous failed approaches
   mentioned in RFC9049.
